    <h2>Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration</h2>
    <p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</p>
    <h3>Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
    <p>
      This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms as the
      “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may
      arise between you and Company, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms (including
      any alleged breach thereof), the Services, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or
      transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration,
      rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that
      you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this
      Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal,
      state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on
      your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and Company are each waiving
      the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be
      determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs
      the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
    </p>
    <h3>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</h3>
    <p>
      YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL
      BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION
      OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND COMPANY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE
      OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM
      OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF
      (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY
      SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S
      INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD
      PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF
      THIS PROVISION.
    </p>
    <h3>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</h3>
    <p>
      Company is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer
      concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer
      support at contact@serenade.ai. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to
      seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute
      (“Notice”). The Notice to Company should be sent to Serenade Labs, Inc., 45 Bartlette St.,
      Unit 510, San Francisco, CA 94110 (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature
      and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Company
      and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received,
      you or Company may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of
      any settlement offer made by Company or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until
      after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Company is entitled.
    </p>
    <h3>Arbitration Procedures</h3>
    <p>
      Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American
      Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer
      Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.
      For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about
      the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration
      page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration. If there is any inconsistency between any term
      of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this
      Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of
      the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair
      arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would.
      All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to
      the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although
      arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other
      judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual
      basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms and applicable law. Decisions by
      the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited
      reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless Company and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a
      reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to
      travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location,
      the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Company agrees
      that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents
      submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as
      established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be
      determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted,
      the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential
      findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
    </p>
    <h3>Costs of Arbitration</h3>
    <p>
      Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration
      Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration
      Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Company will
      pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able
      to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the
      Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not
      be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Company will pay your portion of such
      fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be
      prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Company will pay as much of the
      Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being
      cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
    </p>
    <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
    <p>
      All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the
      arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
    </p>
    <h3>Severability</h3>
    <p>
      If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement
      (other than the subsection (b) titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and
      Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace
      such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes
      closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and
      this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator
      decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and
      Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the
      entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are
      deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive
      relief. The remainder of the Terms will continue to apply.
    </p>
    <h3>Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</h3>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, Company agrees that if it makes
      any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address)
      while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending Company
      written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided
      above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute
      between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you
      first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
    </p>
    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>
      You agree that Company, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any
      part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for
      any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Company believes that you
      have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms. Any suspected
      fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of
      Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Company may also in its
      sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with
      or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any
      provision of these Terms may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that
      Company may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and
      files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further, you
      agree that Company will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your
      access to the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using Service; however all
      Subscription fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable except as expressly provided in the
      next sentence. If you are a user with a paid Subscription, you may contact the Company within
      the first thirty (30) days of beginning your paid Subscription if you wish to terminate your
      Subscription and request a refund.
    </p>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Company and govern your use of the
      Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Company with respect to the Service.
      You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use
      affiliate or third party services, third party content or third party software. These Terms
      will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law
      provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth
      above, you and Company agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state
      and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California. The failure of Company to
      exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such
      right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent
      jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to
      give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions
      of these Terms remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or
      law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the
      Service or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action
      arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in
      electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or
      relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other
      business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may
      not assign these Terms without the prior written consent of Company, but Company may assign or
      transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these
      Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be
      made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes
      to these Terms or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the
      Service.
